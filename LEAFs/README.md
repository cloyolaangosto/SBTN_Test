# LEAF Outputs

Use this directory to store any outputs generated by the LEAF workflows, including intermediate harmonized tables, final factor summaries, and exported maps.

## Suggested organization
- Create a subfolder per run or experiment (for example `LEAFs/2024-04-30_soc/`).
- Keep intermediate artifacts alongside the final deliverables for reproducibility, or archive them externally if they are too large to store in Git.
- Add a short `README.md` inside each run folder that lists the inputs used, the processing commit, and a brief description of the outputs that were produced.

## Version control guidance
The `.gitignore` file in this folder ignores all generated artifacts by default while still allowing lightweight, text-based outputs (for example CSV summaries) to be tracked. This keeps large rasters and other binaries optional while enabling collaborators to review metadata, provenance notes, or sample deliverables.

To commit a specific output, make sure it is a lightweight text file (CSV, JSON, TXT) or update the ignore rules if needed. Large GeoTIFFs and similar binaries should typically remain untracked and hosted externally.

## Sample
A minimal CSV example is provided at [`sample_soc_summary.csv`](sample_soc_summary.csv) to illustrate the expected schema. Replace it with your own summaries when sharing results.

For additional context on how outputs relate to the rest of the project, see the [project README](../README.md) and the run-specific guidance in the documentation and examples.
